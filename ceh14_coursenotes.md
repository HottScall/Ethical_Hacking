<h2> Security Threats </h2>

<h3>Threat Categories </h3>

<strong> Network </strong> – Accessing systems via the Network.  

<strong>MITM </strong> – Man in the middle attacks  

Sit between 2 devices and relay and replay information without their knowledge. You can look at data, manipulate data, steal passwords, and downgrade attacks.  

<strong>DoS/DDoS</strong> – Denial of Service  
Deny people the ability to access sites and apps with some form of error message. Hammer the website with multiple requests which can saturate the bandwidth or overload the CPU.  

<strong>DNS/ARP Poisoning</strong> – Domain Name System, Address Resolution Protocol  
Injection of dynamics updates for DNS or ARP Tables, where you can change the IP address, so now if the consumer logs into the site they log into your backend and you can now see Log On details, if they try and purchase anything then you now have Card Details etc.  

<strong>Host</strong> – Attacking the hardware directly, laptop, PC, Phone, etc.  

Password Cracking  
Malware  
Priv Esc – Privilege Escalation  
Where you have some basics access to a system, but not the full admin access.  
Code Execution  

<strong>Application: </strong>

Injection Attacks – Attacking the Applications that run on an OS, which would give me access to the OS.  
Buffer Overflow  
Security Misconfiguration  

<h3>Types of Systems Attacks</h3>

Application Attacks  
Operating Systems Attacks 
Security Misconfiguration   

<h3>Types of Systems Defence</h3>

<strong>Defensive Security</strong>
System hardening
Patch management updates
Antivirus
Sec awareness training
Web app firewalls. 

<strong>Offensive Security</strong> – 3 types of offensive security   

Annoyance: Honeypots, create an entire fake Infrastructure to wate the actor time.  

Attribution:  Identify attackers using a web bug, a file that allows access to the actor.  

Attacks:  

<h2> Cyber Security Basics </h2>

<h3>Basic Cyber Security Concepts</h3>
Previously known as the CIA Triad, now it's known as the 5 elements of Cyber Security

Confidentiality 
Integrity 
Availbility 
Authenticity 
Non-Repudiation 

<Strong>Confidentiality</Strong> – Something that only certain eyes should have availability to view.   

<Strong>Integrity</Strong> – Ensuring Data has not been changed or modified in an unauthorised way.  

<Strong>Availability</Strong> - Ensuring the Data is available when it needs to be accessed.  

<Strong>Authenticity</Strong> – The data, users, private keys etc are all authentic.  

<Strong>Non-Repudiation</Strong> – Can you verify who sent you the data?

<h3>Attackers. What are their goals and objectives?</h3>

Motives for attacks:  

<Strong>Curiosity</Strong> – Can I do this? Is it possible?  
<Strong>Bragging Rights</Strong> – Look at what I did against big company X.  
<Strong>Disruption of Business</Strong> – Halt or put a stop to your services or products. Damage your reputation, lose customers.  
<Strong>Hacktivism</Strong> – Championing a particular cause, going after your “enemies”. Deface websites and DOS.  
<Strong>Political</Strong>   
<Strong>Religious</Strong>  
<Strong>Terrorism</Strong> – Typically refers to something that involves human casualties on Critical Infrastructure  
<Strong>Revenge</Strong>
<Strong>MONEY, MONEY, MONEY</Strong> – The number 1 motivator behind hacking.
