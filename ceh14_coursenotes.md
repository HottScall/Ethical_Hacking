<h2> Security Threats </h2>

<h3>Threat Categories </h3>

<strong> Network </strong> – Accessing systems via the Network.  

<strong>MITM </strong> – Man in the middle attacks  

Sit between 2 devices and relay and replay information without their knowledge. You can look at data, manipulate data, steal passwords, and downgrade attacks.  

<strong>DoS/DDoS</strong> – Denial of Service  
Deny people the ability to access sites and apps with some form of error message. Hammer the website with multiple requests which can saturate the bandwidth or overload the CPU.  

<strong>DNS/ARP Poisoning</strong> – Domain Name System, Address Resolution Protocol  
Injection of dynamics updates for DNS or ARP Tables, where you can change the IP address, so now if the consumer logs into the site they log into your backend and you can now see Log On details, if they try and purchase anything then you now have Card Details etc.  

<strong>Host</strong> – Attacking the hardware directly, laptop, PC, Phone, etc.  

Password Cracking  
Malware  
Priv Esc – Privilege Escalation  
Where you have some basics access to a system, but not the full admin access.  
Code Execution  

<strong>Application: </strong>

Injection Attacks – Attacking the Applications that run on an OS, which would give me access to the OS.  
Buffer Overflow  
Security Misconfiguration  

<h3>Types of Systems Attacks</h3>

Application Attacks  
Operating Systems Attacks 
Security Misconfiguration   

<h3>Types of Systems Defence</h3>

<strong>Defensive Security</strong>
System hardening
Patch management updates
Antivirus
Sec awareness training
Web app firewalls. 

<strong>Offensive Security</strong> – 3 types of offensive security   

Annoyance: Honeypots, create an entire fake Infrastructure to wate the actor time.  

Attribution:  Identify attackers using a web bug, a file that allows access to the actor.  

Attacks:  

<h2> Cyber Security Basics </h2>

<h3>Basic Cyber Security Concepts</h3>
Previously known as the CIA Triad, now it's known as the 5 elements of Cyber Security

Confidentiality 
Integrity 
Availbility 
Authenticity 
Non-Repudiation 

<Strong>Confidentiality</Strong> – Something that only certain eyes should have availability to view.   

<Strong>Integrity</Strong> – Ensuring Data has not been changed or modified in an unauthorised way.  

<Strong>Availability</Strong> - Ensuring the Data is available when it needs to be accessed.  

<Strong>Authenticity</Strong> – The data, users, private keys etc are all authentic.  

<Strong>Non-Repudiation</Strong> – Can you verify who sent you the data?

<h3>Attackers. What are their goals and objectives?</h3>

Motives for attacks:  

<Strong>Curiosity</Strong> – Can I do this? Is it possible?  
<Strong>Bragging Rights</Strong> – Look at what I did against big company X.  
<Strong>Disruption of Business</Strong> – Halt or put a stop to your services or products. Damage your reputation, lose customers.  
<Strong>Hacktivism</Strong> – Championing a particular cause, going after your “enemies”. Deface websites and DOS.  
<Strong>Political</Strong>   
<Strong>Religious</Strong>  
<Strong>Terrorism</Strong> – Typically refers to something that involves human casualties on Critical Infrastructure  
<Strong>Revenge</Strong> MONEY, MONEY, MONEY</Strong> – The number 1 motivator behind hacking.  

<h3>Attack Classifications</h3>
Types of attacks:  

<Strong>Passive Attacks:</Strong> Looking for things on a Network which uses clear text, such as clear text passwords. Sensitive information or PII (Personally Identifiable Information). Almost impossible to detect.  
Uses tolls like: Wire Sniffer, Packet Sniffer, Protocol Analyser. Wire Shark.  

<Strong>Active Attacks:</Strong>
Data Manipulation  
Denial or Disruption of Services (DoS) 
Breaking into systems or network 
Password Attacks 
Session Hijacking  
Privileged Escalation  
SQL Injection  
Remote Code Execution  

<Strong>Close in Attacks:</Strong> Through proximity of my target, I can get information. Gain proximity to the target, shoulder surfing and dumpster diving.  
 
<Strong>Insider Attacks/Threats:</Strong> Essentially someone who is a spy or a double agent, someone who has access to systems, but they can abuse some trust. One of the most devastating types of attacks, mainly based on the trust.  
Pod Slurping – Use a digital storage device such as an iPod to extract data from an organisation.  
Steal a device.  

<Strong>Close-in Attacks:</Strong> As long as you have a contact within an organisation. Essentially tricking you into divulging that information.  

<Strong>Distribution Attacks:</Strong> Normally evolves around a 3rd party. Attacker has access to either software or hardware vendors, attack them, plant yourself in their system and then install something like malware into a software device which will eventually go to your actual target.  

<h3>Information Warfare</h3>

<Strong>C2 (Command and Control) Warfare:</Strong> Control over compromised targets and their compromised systems. Advanced Persistent Threats (APT’s) will aim to do this constantly. Will affect or influence our opposition.   
<Strong>Intelligence Based Warfare:</Strong> Design and Protection of systems that seeks to gain knowledge to dominate the battlespace, plus the denial of knowledge to your adversaries.  

<Strong>Electronic Based Warfare: </Strong> Stopping communications between adversaries. This could be Signal Jamming, Radar Jamming, bring down email server, stop Wifi from working.  

<Strong>Psychological Warfare: </Strong> Disinformation campaigns. Attacking the morale or mental resolve, get them to give up through things like propaganda.  

<Strong>Hacker Warfare:</Strong> DoS, Electronic Theft, Espionage.  

<Strong>Economic Warfare:</Strong> How to disrupt your adversaries, whether that be financial systems, get you to lose customers etc etc. Anything that hits the company in the pocket. 

<Strong>Cyber Warfare:</Strong> Information Terrorism, Semantic Attacks (Attackers are in your system, but aren’t detected so they lie in wait until the time is right to attack) 

<Strong>Simulated Warfare:</Strong>Display of weapons or power.  

<h4>Information Warfare Strategies</h4> 

<Strong>Defensive Information Warfare:</Strong> Detection, Prevention, Alerting, response systems, emergency actions, deterrents.  

<Strong>Offensive Information Warfare:</Strong> Web based attacks, system hacking, MITM, Replay Attacks, Session Hijacking
